WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. It leverages the power of the GPU to create complex visualizations and animations.

1. 2. **What is Three.js?**  
Three.js is a JavaScript library built on top of WebGL that simplifies the process of creating and displaying 3D graphics in the browser. It provides abstractions and utilities to make working with 3D scenes, objects, and animations more accessible.
